# easyserver
A serverside script, that saves data, allows users to change their details and provides an API over which this data can be accessed.
~~At the moment this is mainly in development, so you'll find unnecessary files, unfinished and bad looking code, but mostly not working features.~~

I froze the developement, lack of time and desire to finish it. Feel free to update, commit or improve by making changes to this script!

To-Do's: [see related issue](https://github.com/johangroe/easyserver/issues/1)
