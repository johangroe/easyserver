# easyserver
A serverside script, that saves data, allows users to change their details and provides an API over which this data can be accessed.

To do are still:
- finish the signup and password recovery process
- write the admin console
- write an API library and publish it on pypi.org (name "easyserver" is temporarily squatted)
- host the script for demo and test purposes on i.e. pythonanywhere.com
- write the docs
