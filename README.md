# easyserver
A serverside script, that saves data, allows users to change their details and provides an API over which this data can be accessed.
At the moment this is mainly in development, so you'll find unnecessary files, unfinished and bad looking code, but mostly not working features.

To do are still (more detailed in the issues):
- finish the signup and password recovery process
- write the admin console
- write an API library and publish it on pypi.org (name "easyserver" is temporarily squatted, sorry for that)
- host the script for demo and test purposes on i.e. pythonanywhere.com
- write the docs
